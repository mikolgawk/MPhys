# AI approach to materials with flat electronic bands hosting exotic physics

## MPhys Project by Mateusz Czajka and Mikolaj Gawkowski
## Supervised by Anupam Bhattacharya and Artem Mishchenko, The University of Manchester

## Project description
The goal of the project is to identify flat bands in electronic structures of 3D materials.
A convolutional neural network trained using Matlab is used to identify flat segments in band structures.

The work is based on
